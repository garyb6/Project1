Bucket List App

Brief:

Build an app to track someone's travel adventures. 

MVP:
The app should allow the user to track countries and stadiums they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create and edit countries
Each country should have one or more stadiums to visit
The user should be able to create and delete entries for stadiums
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see

Possible Extensions:
Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
Add sights to the destination stadiums 
Search for destination by continent, stadium or country
Any other ideas you might come up with

Personal Learning Plan Objectives:

Planning - ensuring that my models, pages and site have been at lest sketched out and wireframes completed to give me an idea and aim to achieve. 

CSS - I will ensure I invest time to properly go through CSS styling, ensuring the basics are consolidated and push myself to ensure the app appearance is more than just satisfactory. 

Ensuring pages are correctly accessed - Within the last couple of weeks, I have struggled to ensure my pages are accessed using IDs/links etc. struggling with writing the functions to enable this. This project gives the perfect opportunity to remedy this. 

Get up and running:

1. Git pull Project1, link: https://github.com/garyb6/Project1 
2. Open the directory in your chosen code editor
3. Create database stadium_bucket_list.sql through either terminal or psql terminal
4. Execute the PostgreSQL script in terminal: 'psql -d stadium_bucket_list -f stadium_bucket_list.sql'
5. Run console.py file ('python3 console.py') in terminal
6. At this point you could run positco or another programme to doublecheck the database has been created
7. Run Flask ('flask run' in terminal) and open local page in your chosen browser (Chrome is suggested)
8. To exit flask, use ctrl+C to stop it running
